# AHAT Stack


A stack for web development using the following projects

- **A**stro
- **H**TMX for fetching server state as HTML and updating the DOM
- **A**lpine for clientside Javascript in your HTML
- **T**ailwind for CSS

---

This allows this HTML-first approach that [HTMX preaches](https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas/)

You can use Astro for static files, router etc, but also run functions and pages on the server.

Makes use of the new partials in Astro 3.4
